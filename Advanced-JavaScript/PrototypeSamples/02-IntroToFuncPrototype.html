        //01--> A function itself is an object, thus it would have its own "__proto__" definition (along with its own "prototype" def)
        var Product = function(){
            this.Id = null;
        };
        alert(Product.prototype); //we already knew this
        alert(Product.__proto__); //cool. But, where does this refer to?

        //02--> "Function" is a built-in constructor function.  Any user defined function is an instance of "Function".
        // "Function.prototype" is the default (or parent) prototype object for all (user defined or instantiated) functions.
        //  When any function is defined, a new instance of "Function" gets created and
        //  all members in "Function.prototype" gets copied to the new function.
        alert(Function); //shows native implementation of Function
        Function.prototype.alertOnce = function(){ //modify the "Function.prototype"
            alert("from Function.prototype");
        };

        //Now, "Employee" is an instance of "Function" (at the same time, it is a constructor function)
        var Employee = function(){
            this.Name = null;
        };

        Employee.alertOnce(); //valid (as it gets copied from "Function.prototype"
        alert(Employee.__proto__ == Function.prototype); //true
        Product.alertOnce(); //not to be surprised, "prototype" property is dynamic and affects all instances instantaneously

        //03-->Summary:
        //  -A function itself is an object (and can also be a construction function to serve as a class to create instances)
        //  -Every function is an instance of "Function" (which is a built-in constructor function and also an object on its own and has its own "property" and "__proto")
        //  -The "__proto__" of any function instance defaults to "Function.prototype"
