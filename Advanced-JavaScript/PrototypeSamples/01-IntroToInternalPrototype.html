        };
        alert(Product.prototype); //the default prototype is empty (no members)

        //02-->When an instance of "Product" is created, all the members in constructor function and
        //  all the members in "Product.prototype" will be made available to the new instance
        Product.prototype.showMsgFromProductPrototype = function(){ //change the "Product.prototype" definition

        oProduct.Id = "1001"; //assign some properties
        oProduct.showMsgFromProductPrototype(); //"showMsgFromProductPrototype" is automatically made available to the new instance

        //03-->an instance (from a constructor function) will never have a "prototype" property (by default)
        alert(oProduct.prototype); //results in undefined

        //04-->any instance will always have an internal property "__proto__",
        //  which gives the reference to "prototype" object, from where the instance copied its members.
        alert(oProduct.__proto__); //gives the reference to "Product.prototype" (may not work in certain IE browsers)
        alert(oProduct.constructor.prototype) //you can also use "constructor.prototype" instead of "__proto__" (works everywhere)
        alert(oProduct.__proto__ == Product.prototype); //true

        //05-->"prototype" property is dynamic => any modifications to "prototype" object is instantaneously made available to all of its instances
        Product.prototype.showMsgFromProductPrototype = function(){ //let us further modify the same function

        oProduct.showMsgFromProductPrototype(); //did not create a new instance, but the new def is immediately available
        oProduct.dispMsgFromProductPrototype(); //did not create a new instance, but the new def is immediately available

        //05-->Summary:
        //  A property "prototype" exists for every constructor function
        //  A property "prototype" does not exist for any instantiated object (by default)
        //  An instance gets created by copying (or allocating memory for) all members in the constructor function plus all members in the constructor function's own "prototype" property
        //  Modifying "prototype" property will have instantaneous affect on all its instances (including the old ones)
        //  A property "__proto__" exists for every object, which refers to the "prototype" property from where the instance copied its members

        //P.S. Play using browser's integrated console developer tool to get more information of those properties (rather than using alerts, which may not make sense to understand)
