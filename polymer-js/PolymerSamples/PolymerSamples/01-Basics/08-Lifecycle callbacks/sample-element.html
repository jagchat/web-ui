            //Note that the initialization order may vary depending on whether 
            //or not the browser includes native support for web components. 
            //In particular, there are no guarantees with regard to initialization timing between 
            //sibling elements or between parents and light DOM children. 
            //You should not rely on observed timing to be identical across browsers, except as noted below.
            //For a given element:
            //  The created "callback" is always called before "ready".
            //  The ready "callback" is always called before "attached".
            //  The ready "callback" is called on any local DOM children before it’s called on the host element.
            //This means that an element’s light DOM children may be initialized before or after the parent element, and an element’s siblings may become ready in any order.
